Things to do:
- Dynamically loadable drivers?
- Driver interface for querying how large (in bytes) a given data type is.
  Allows users to preallocate buffers and know what to expect for record size.
- Interface to describe data schema (making Hound self-describing).
- Optimize drv_alloc, since both struct records and struct record_info are
  short-lived.
