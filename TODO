Things to do:
- Allow drivers to be individually compiled in or not.
- Document Hound design, including core, drivers, and schemas
- IIO automated unit tests, using the kernel dummy IIO driver
- GPS automated unit tests, automatically starting up gpsfake from the gpsd
  distribution.
- IIO driver dynamically listing sysfs entries and doing string parsing to
  figure out possible channels (like iio_generic_buffer does), instead of
  hardcoding these.
- Optimize drv_alloc, since both record data and struct record_info are
  short-lived.
- Audit logging to make it consistent throughout the code.
