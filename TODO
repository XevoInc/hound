Things to do:
- IIO automated unit tests, using the kernel dummy IIO driver
- GPS automated unit tests, automatically starting up gpsfake from the gpsd
  distribution.
- IIO driver dynamically listing sysfs entries and doing string parsing to
  figure out possible channels (like iio_generic_buffer does), instead of
  hardcoding these.
- Dynamically loadable drivers?
- Driver interface for querying how large (in bytes) a given data type is.
  Allows users to preallocate buffers and know what to expect for record size.
- Interface to describe data schema (making Hound self-describing).
- Optimize drv_alloc, since both record data and struct record_info are
  short-lived.
- Audit logging to make it consistent throughout the code.
