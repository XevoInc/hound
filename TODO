Things to do:
- A driver that reads from a file
- A CAN driver
- An IIO driver
- The protocol driver stack
- Dynamically loadable drivers?
- Figure out how to fix or eliminate the variadic macro in log.h. It is not
  C11-safe (requires GNU11), so it forces users to use GNU11 as well, which is
  very bad.
