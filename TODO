Things to do:
- Small refactor so that drivers cannot change the sequence number in their
  parse methods. Use a struct+union so the driver can set the relevant parts of
  hound_record without being able to see the seqno field.
- A CAN driver
- An IIO driver
- The protocol driver stack
- Dynamically loadable drivers?
